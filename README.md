# Application Runtime Proposals Repository
This repository contains a summary of each runtime proposals and their current state. We will use a single file (runtime-proposal(year).md) to store below summary information for each proposal. This file will serve as a cumulative history of runtime propsoals for a given year. For the archived proposals, please go to [Cloud Foundry CF Dev Archive](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-dev/topics). 

As the state of each proposal changes, proposal author should update its status in the file.  Community members should add incoming proposals to the top of the file so that its content is ordered chronologically from the most recent article. As a year ends, we will create a new file with a yearly extension for the next year. 

This repository will also serve as a starting place for incoming issues that could potentially need cross cutting team coordination. If at the time when a runtime issue is discovered and it is not clear on which component should address the root cause, please use this repository.

Included in this repository is a runtime proposal template that community members can leverage.
