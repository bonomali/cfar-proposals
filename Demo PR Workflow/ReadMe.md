This is a demo using GitHUB PR to help track proposal status. 
We intend to use various to help with filtering of proposals. 
For example, we can adopt 'cfar-proposal' as parent tag in addition to a child tag corresponding to each team for each proposal. 
We will use PR states Open and Closed as main signals to convey propsoal status so that it would be self serving. 
Using tags to reflect proposal status of Draft | In Review | Planned | In Progress | Complete | Obsolete 
could be an option but may incur too much overhead to proposal author.
