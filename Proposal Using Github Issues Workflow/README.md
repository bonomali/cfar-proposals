This is a proposal to GitHub issues to help track proposal status. We intend to use various tags to help with filtering of proposals.
Each issue should contain a parent label in addition to a child label corresponding to each runtime component team.

* Parent label: cfar-proposal (all isseus should include)
* Child labels: cli, capi, services api, bits-service, uaa, permissions, garden, eirini, garden-windows, diego, persi, networking, haproxy, loggregatorm, infra, relint, postgres, mysql

Please open one issue per proposal. Issue should only be closed when **implementation is complete** or when **proposal has been abandoned**.
We recommend as a best practice to add a target milestone. Please see demo issue for details. A github template has been created to be used for your convenience.

**Workflow**
* Open an issue for a new proposal
* Update with relevant content
* Be sue key detaiuls have been included
* Update propoal status as it cycles through 
* Close issue with appropriate resolution
