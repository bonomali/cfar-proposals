This is a proposal to GitHub Issues to help track proposal status. We intend to use various tags to help with filtering of proposals. Each issue will contain a parent label in addition to a child label corresponding to each runtime component team.

* Parent label: cfar-proposal (all issues should have by default)
* Child labels: cli, capi, services api, bits-service, uaa, permissions, garden, eirini, garden-windows, diego, persi, networking, haproxy, loggregatorm, infra, relint, postgres, mysql (to be added by proposal author)

Please open one issue per proposal. Issue should only be closed when **implementation is complete** or when **proposal has been deemed obsolete**.
We recommend as a best practice to add a target milestone. Please see demo issue for details. A github template has been created to be used for your convenience.

**Workflow**
* Open an issue for a new proposal
* Select custom template "Runtime proposal"
* Update with content
* As proposal cycles through different status, please update issue to reflect accurate status
* Close issue with relevant information (github link or reason for obsolete)
* Check CFAR Proposal Kanban under Projects tab to see status of all proposals
